# Standard JavaScript Library

> A standard library for a programming language is the library that is conventionally made available in every implementation of that language. In some cases, the library is described directly in the programming language specification; in other cases, the contents of the standard library are determined by more informal social practices in the programming community.
-[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_library)

Most programming languages come with standard libraries. JavaScript does not. Or at least, the one it has is very limited.

With [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org/), this will eventually be fixed. In the meantime, there's this.

## Organization

Standard-js is built to be modular - use what you need, throw out what you don't.
* core/ - core is designed to include primary JS functionality
* browser/ - browser specific code - DOM stuff and the like
* etc/ - additional functionality

Note that there are many many useful libraries that have not yet been copied here.
* sprintf
