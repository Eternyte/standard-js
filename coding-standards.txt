General script rules:
0) All of these rules are optional. But you must comment if you are breaking them.
1) No loops, ever. Except in Core/
2) No DOM manipulation, ever. Except in Views/
3) No touching the server, ever. Except in Models/
4) Internal scope functions start with underscores, to highlight their hiddenness. The widest scope is always capitalized, to highlight its wideness.
5) Consistency over improvement. If you're going to improve something, improve it all at once. Consistent code can be auto-refactored, partially improved code cannot.
6) Core functions cannot have any dependencies, aside from jQuery.
7) The primary standard of code review: How possible is it to explain this to my grandma?
8) Hungarian notation: You may choose that all parameters to a function begin with p. Why? A consistent solution to the reserved words problem (we use the word class a lot), as well as a clear indication of scope.

Miscellaneous thoughts you can ignore:
1) There are two major inheritance options in JavaScript: Prototypal and closure. They each have benefits, but neither is particularly deadly if carefully managed.
